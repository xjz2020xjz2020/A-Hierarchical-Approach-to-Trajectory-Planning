# A-Hierarchical-Approach-to-Trajectory-Planning
Code Resource of Paper - A Hierarchical Approach to Trajectory Planning for Autonomous Vehicles on Curvy Roads

1）The traditional DP algorithm and the Jump-Node (JN) DP algorithm about my manuscript are both realized by C++ code and Matlab code. Compared to the traditional DP algorithm, the Jump-Node (JN) DP algorithm speedup the computering speed by 30.6%. The test result is excuted in Ubuntu VS code. C++code saves a lot of runtime compared to Matlab code.

2）In the same setting of random obstacle vehicles, C++ code and Matlab code can get the same corase trjectory planning, as can be tested in the file of "statedata.txt". Other than Jump-Node (JN) DP algorithm,the functions of my manuscript are all realized by Matlab code for coding efficiency.
